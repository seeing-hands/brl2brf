# BRL2BRF Release History
For more information, see the readme.md file or the project page at [https://github.com/seeing-hands/brl2brf]
## Version 1.1.0
This version includes many changes for developers. Several user-facing changes are noticeable as well, though existing workflows are unlikely to need changes with one exception.
* Additions
    * New formats supported
        * This version can decode and encode Unicode Braille files, including 8-dot characters
        * This version can decode KWB files, generated by old Humanware BrailleNote devices
        * This version can encode and decode Braille files from HelpTech displays, including 8-dot characters
    * New parameters:
        * -c/--converter: Used to explicitly add a converter to the operation. This is likely not of use in format conversion but has been introduced for other transformations.
        * -co/--converter-option: Used to set options for a converter. Use the format --converter-option <converter name>.<option name>=<value>.
        * --converter-help <converter>: Used to get information and options for a given converter.
    * Changes:
        * Since there are more formats, unspecified formats are no longer guessed. If file names or patterns make it possible to guess a format, the program will still do so. If they do not, the format will need to be specified manually.
        * The program is no longer feasible to distribute as a single Python script. It now consists of 8 files. The installation instructions have been updated.

## Version 1.0.1
* Changes
    * Previously, BRF files were generated with Unix line breaks (\n). Some BRF files use Windows line breaks instead, and as far as we can tell, those files are handled correctly by all systems. Since no specification exists, we have changed the converter to use Windows line breaks for BRF files.
* Bug fixes
    * Fixed a bug that could fail to get the converter during single file conversion

## Version 1.0.0
* First release
